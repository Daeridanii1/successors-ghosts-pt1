	set "successors: ghosts stage 0"
	planet "Qasa-Sija-Iri"
		description `Until recently, this moon was an utterly unremarkable uninhabited world within House Kaatrij's sphere of influence. However, near the south pole, the exposed guts of a strange facility now twinkle and shimmer half-enveloped in the moon's sands. A large military presence by House Kaatrij repels any closer inspection, but regardless, it seems that Qasa-Sija-Iri is not quite as uninhabited as it immediately appeared.`
