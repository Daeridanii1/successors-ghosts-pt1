			`You once again descend to the dusty moon, though this time with the authorization to pass through the blockade. The ring-shaped base is now nowhere to be seen, but as you proceed to your landing coordinates, a shimmering aperture opens in the sand to reveal an advanced landing bay. As you set the <ship> down inside it, the top closes up again, sealing you off from the outside. The time wears on before you are allowed to exit the landing bay, but eventually one of the ground crew informs you that you've been granted access to some of the facility outside the bay's armored doors.`
			`	The inside of the facility is a strange mixture of Successor and Quarg styling; the bulk of the structure is made of Quarg materials and the various interfaces and bits of equipment are clearly Quarg technology, but Successor - or to the Quarg, Myiaran - gold threads line the ceiling and floors of the corridors. Both Quarg and Myiara, all of whom wear Kaatrij's colors, walk through the spacious halls.`

			`	On the other side, Saajret and a number of other members of House Kaatrij stand along with a single Quarg. Several of Saajret's arms are folded about themself, and their skin shows hues of tension. They and the rest of Kaatrij splay their arms in greeting as you enter; the Quarg merely examines you.`
			`	"This is captain <last>," says Saajret, "in the flesh. We have all noted the captain's exploits among these stars; most relevant of which, today, was the placement of scanning eyes throughout the Shroud at Seineq's past request. Their craft may jump between the stars unhinder'd, and thus may undo these as we've desir'd, 'thout the risk of exposing us evermore."`
			`	One of the other Myiara eyes Saajret and wriggles before they speak. "Exposing us is just what the captain's presence here creates. Already the other Houses use this naif t'propel their aims against our wound. Thou hast trusted far too quickly, Saajret, think'th I."`

"The scanners that thou placed note jumps of the proper sort, as made by thy craft and ours and the Quarg's alike. But the flitting of our foe, of which earlier to thee I spoke, relies on aught uncanni'r that we think evades their gaze. Thus, they reveal not the comings and goings of the guilty, but of Kaatrij ourselves. By this we think the craft thou found was snared."`

If the captain and thee completes your task, 'tis all the better. As thou hast already seen fit to induct them into knowledge of this," they add. "'Tis little you can do with this to worsen aught."`
			`	The other Myiara display various motions of assent, and eventually all of them leave the room, leaving only you, Saajret, and the Quarg, who continues to look over you with interest. Eventually, it speaks, its voice rumbling much deeper than those of the Myiara. "So strange," it says in your own language, "to see one of your kind after so many years, and here, where none were meant to tread. Perhaps the threads of the universe now constrict. Despite all the Drak have done, the separations seem not to last."`

Two tasks lie before us, with thou included if thou wilt: first, we must assess how our citadel has been plunder'd.

			`As you approach a central docking port on the citadel, alarms momentarily ring throughout the <ship>'s bridge as numerous weapon locks are detected. A moment later they cease and Saajret radios you from their own craft that it is safe to land, the shape of the Vujlet disappearing into the station's wide mouth.`
			`	The inside is truly cavernous; the circular vault of the station's core forms an artificial sky, the landing pad for your ship a stamp-sized rectangle on its perimeter. Saajret exits from their landed ship and meets you with a pair of Kaatrij soldiers; you recognize one as having accompanied Saajret before when they interrogated you. "I've added us as allies in the station's security rolls," says Saajret. "It should permit us access below." They check a data-pad that they produce from one of their pockets, looking from the shifting metallic screen to the layout of the docking bay. Eventually, they point to one of several circular apertures on the floor. As you approach, a large elevator pod emerges from it and its doors open expectantly.`
			choice
				`	"What's with the Myiara and these massive constructions?"`

					goto down
			`	Saajret is speckled with mirth and hums. "Myiara?" they say. "'Twas the Quarg that told thee this, no doubt. Ah, but to answer thy query: for Kaatrij at least, 'twas a simple matter of geometry. To cloak a station is a function of its armor, its surface - the power to feed that cloak is a function of its volume. A larger citadel was more efficient to hide away." They rub the tips of two of their arms over a data-sphere embedded in the elevator pod.`
			choice
				`	"How far down are we going?"`

			label down
			`	"We shall want to check the systems core and the vault, at least," says Saajret. "A very long way, for certain."`
			`	The elevator takes the four of you down for several minutes; every once in a while, a window to the outside shows individual flashes of the sun setting as the station continues in its orbit. It finally stops on a platform overlooking a vast, dizzyingly-tall space, where pillars rise up for what seems like kilometers below you and terminate kilometers above. Myriad cargo containers are attached to their sides, and between them rest eight gleaming starships. Some of the designs are familiar, like polished versions of those you've seen in Successor space; others are entirely new to you.`
			`	Saajret directs their two soldiers to set up a trio of small poles on the surface of the platform. They then radio to their ship and the poles light up, projecting barely-visible laser scanning beams throughout the vast space. After a couple of seconds, they mutter something to themself and order the soldiers to pack up the scanners.`

			`	You all return to the elevator and it once again begins to plunge you deeper into the citadel. You start to feel something prickling in your ear, but it is gone as soon as it began. The views of outside stop and the elevator shaft seems to grow darker and redder as the four of you travel deeper. Eventually it reaches another platform, but the door of the elevator refuses to open. Saajret enters some commands on the elevator controls, and the reason is revealed: as the elevator's door blushes transparent, you can see the corridor behind it has been perforated and torn open from outside. In the distance you can see a blast door leading into an armored, spherical construction, but that too has been blasted apart.`
			`	Saajret mutters darkly and once again orders the soldiers to set up the scanners, and once again they project their beams, now through the transparent door and into the breached segment. A wave of black ruffles over Saajret's skin. "All but one of the station's cloaking nodes have been remov'd. So strange..." they say, "to have stolen these and yet left the vault unassailed." The wave passes, leaving only colorlessness in its wake. "We must bring this news with haste. Let us hurry back."`
			`	All of a sudden, the station's comm system crackles to life. A rapid series of interweaving clicks emerge, and they soon shift and warp in your ears as your translation device begins to interpret them. "Interloper!" something screams, and you feel dizzy. "Despoiler! Invading wretch!"`
			choice
				`	(Rip off the translation device.)`
				`	(Try to block out the sounds.)`
			`	As soon as you move, something punches against your inner ear and you crumple to the ground. The seething voice continues, "Thou cometh again and again to raid and pillage, again and again to prod what should for all time be left in peace!" Saajret is standing over you speaking, but you can't make out their words. "First Kaatrij's little beasts, then on stars and the homeworld, and now thou cometh again with thy gleaming herald, a dread heirloom!"`
			choice
				`	"I'm trying to stop the thieves!"`
				`	"How are you in my head!?"`
			`	The rage of the artificial voice chills. "Insignificant," it says. "Thou has now passed the threshold for destruction." Something else is now interleaving with the words, something sharp and painful. You cry out in pain, and then suddenly it all stops. The pressure fades away from your head and the world resounds with silence. Saajret looks down at you, the translation device plucked from you and held in their arm. They help you to your feet and return it to you; you store it in a pocket, deactivated.`
			`	Saajret confers with their guards for a moment, unintelligibly. "Tilruu-nne nuj. Veusa." One of them interacts with the elevator controls and the carriage starts to move upwards again.` # We need to go up now. Quickly. 
			`	They continue talking with their guards as the elevator travels back up. The com system shrieks again to no avail. Saajret comes to speak to you, gently poking your chest with the tip of one of their arms; they say something that sounds a bit like your name. Suddenly the elevator is shaken by an impact from outside and soon after, dozens more. It finally deposits you back in the landing bay as you see the shape of a ship in the distance firing on the station. You dash back to your own ship and prepare to flee or fight.`

			`Aava-Aasa-Khora's monorail system is as efficient and quiet as it was before, shuttling you off to another one of the numerous installations dotting the planet's surface. You are eventually deposited at the lobby of one that looks remarkably similar to the one you visited when you were presented the Successor license; it's large and richly decorated, the walls a riot of color and form that is as ostentatious as it is impressive. A gentle mist issues from apertures on the vaulted ceiling and long golden threads trail downwards, writhing around particular Successors and eventually, you.`
			`	The thread inspects your face and clothing for a short time before it speaks in a soft, synthesized voice. "Greetings, Captain <first> <last>! Thou'rt authorized to attend the ceremony this afternoon and, following, a special meeting of the locally-gathered Houses." The voice continues for a while, providing you with information on which rooms to visit and how you are to find your way there.`

			`	While most Successors are waiting outside the entrance to what must be a massive room, you are instead guided to an inconspicuous and out-of-the-way door, guarded by a pair of Successor soldiers. Neither one reacts to your attempt to pass, and as you step behind the door, it becomes clear why you aren't lining up with the general public: that massive room is entirely filled with water, a gigantic sphere with lights, platforms, and countless seats all built within it. A few small rooms like the one you now stand in are built into the walls like little transparent air bubbles at the shore of a great sea.`
			`	You are joined by three other Successors after a few minutes, each of whom takes their place in the little room. The ceremony begins shortly after. From apertures in the bottom of the sphere, legions of soldiers emerge, half wearing the colors of House Chydiyi and the other half of House Myurej.`
