Though you must descend slowly to avoid disturbing the atmosphere, you eventually find your way over the sandy surface to right above the now-revealed base House Kaatrij went to so much effort to hide.`
			`	As you once saw in the news broadcast, the outline of it is an enormous circle several kilometers in radius. Though the shimmering effect is now gone and some of the damage has been repaired, much of it still remains visible and there appears to be ongoing work on the damaged sections - House Kaatrij-registered freighters land on temporary landing pads and offload massive amounts of materials, some familiar, some not.`
			`	Most striking of all, however, is the appearance of some familiar-looking dark metal and purple lighting in the damaged section of the base; it's hard to be certain, but it bears a distinct resemblance to Quarg technology. Perhaps the Quarg might be able to provide some answers about what's been going on.`
			`	Not long after you see this, a thin sandstorm starts to roll in, and you take the <ship> back up to orbit before the mysterious absence of airborne grit gives your ship away.`

			`	Though so far individual Quarg have seemed equivalent in their ability to answer your questions, it is several minutes before you spot one here who, for some reason, seems like it would be able to answer. When you repeat your question to it, it blinks slowly, and answers even more so.`
			`	"I see," it says. "You have uncovered one our great secrets of the galaxy. You were right to think that the world you speak of is ours. After what that foolish species did to themselves, we the Quarg could not bear to leave them unobserved. But we dared not do so unshrouded, lest we once again rouse them to the heights of envy - so we built no ringworld, no stations, no open worlds. Only a little... watching post, to keep our gaze over the Myiara."`
			`	You interject. "The Myiara? Do you mean the Successors?"`
			`	The Quarg considers the term. "Before they called themselves that, they were the Myiara. Have they truly become so rooted in their memories of their valorous past?" It makes a noise like the rumbling of distant thunder. "You must have questions."`
			choice
				`	"What is it that they did to themselves? Did they build some kind of terrible weapons?"`
					goto what
				`	"I didn't think hiding away was in your nature."`
					goto hiding
			label what
			`	"No," says the Quarg, "not weapons. That you have met them shows that you have found, or stolen, the secret to sail between the stars unhindered. Long, long ago, the Drak discovered that secret for the first time, and after many years, they shared it with us, the Quarg, so that peace and amity might reign in the galaxy. Then, only a few thousand human years ago, the Myiara found it too." The Quarg blinks slowly, and its whole body slumps as if burdened by a great sorrow.`
			`	"What they discovered was not what the Drak had, nor the beauty that the Korath, despite all their warring, had wrought. It was a new and dangerous thing, and while it let them explore with new freedom, in the years that followed, its mark became clear. It rent wounds among the stars, tore apart the paths between them, led their ships away to nowhere, and turned their verdant worlds to ash."`
			choice
				`	"Why did you allow them to develop something so destructive?"`
					goto allow
				`	"How did you keep yourselves hidden for so long?"`
					goto hiding
			label allow
			`	"They were then upon the precipice of a great change. Their long-wrought divisions were melding; they had turned away from the gruesome vagaries of war, and were moved to explore and preserve the arts of others. We hoped," and the Quarg imparts a heightened tone on this word, "that in time, they could become as we are, guardians and friends to all. Our judgment was clouded by our desire for this."`
			choice
				`	"It's hard to believe they were ever so unified."`
				`	"You saw them as equals to yourselves?"`
			`	A demeanor of great reflection passes over the Quarg, and then is gone just as quickly. "The Myiara were like... children, just beginning to concieve of and adopt the responsibilities that lie beyond youth. Full of cleverness and arrogance still, but borne aloft by a new-blooming capacity to see beyond themselves and their own base concerns."`
			`	"How did you keep yourself hidden from them for so long?"`
			label hiding
			`	"Hiding indeed does not come naturally to us," the Quarg says. "With no other have we had need to conceal ourselves. One of their houses, when it knew what they had done, agreed to work with us to preserve their species. They were most skilled in matters of illusion, and shared their cloaks with us to obscure our presence."`
				goto end
			label end
			`	"What troubles this one most, though," says the Quarg, "is that this watching post of ours was laid bare to see at all. We made ourselves rancid to the Myiara for their own good, stole away their precious creations, worked with those of them who would help us to tear down so much of what they had built, sealed them away - all so they would not have the means to recreate their folly in a later age. That this deception of ours has come to light may drive them even further from what they were, undo even the meager gains they have wrought in their exile. For all their wrong, that would still be a cause for lament."`
			`	With that, the Quarg offers you a gentle bow. "Goodbye now, Captain," they say, and quietly walk away.`
