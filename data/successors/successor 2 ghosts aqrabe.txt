			`Shortly after landing here, you are approached by a tall Successor in unusual dress; though dark, it shimmers in the light with many little golden flecks. It is unlike any other Successor outfit you've seen. "Greetings, Captain," they say, curiously sonorous. "Noble House Aqrabe kindly requests thy presence in the eastern spaceport reliquary. I've been instructed to take thee there, at thy own discretion, of course."`

			`	They lead you through several restricted areas of the spaceport to a thin tower on its periphery. The room you enter into is tremendous and circular; a shallow watery depression in the center is matched by an enormous semicircular tank that bulges down from above, almost touching the floor as it swoops towards the wet floor. What's inside it proves even more striking, however: soon, what look like the severed limbs of Successors begin to writhe downwards in the tank, each suspended by a number of glittering golden threads that snake up into the dark abyss of the overhead water. You look around to ask your guide what's happening, but they have already left. One of the arms rubs up against the glass, its undead suckers making faint popping sounds as they pass over it.`

They're intrigued by thee. Only one of them ever saw something of your kind, and it did not expect to ever see one of you again - not even in eternity."`

How queer an introduction is to thee, for thou art the only one here for whom 't'would be needed." They make a noise you're sure is chuckling. "A scion of Aqrabe's House - by marriage, not by blood. But only just. But no, tell me, how is it that our wormhole grants thee passage 'thout a well-equipped ship of ours?"`

	`	"Yes?"`

Tilra joins you in walking back to the <ship> to examine the cargo; when they're sufficiently satisfied that you've brought the proper amount, they pull out a data-pad and enter a couple of values. Though their eyes widen when you provide them with your receipts, they nonetheless confirm a few moments later that House Aqrabe has credited you to offset the purchase price of the keystones, plus a three hundred thousand-credit bonus.`
	`	As they begin directing ground crews to offload the keystones, Tilra turns to you for a moment and requests that you meet them back at the spaceport by the end of the day: "thine assistance might be a boon to us in the next part of this journey," they say.`
