			`Shortly after landing here, you are approached by a tall Successor in unusual dress; though dark, it shimmers in the light with many little golden flecks. It is unlike any other Successor outfit you've seen. "Greetings, Captain," they say, curiously sonorous. "Noble House Aqrabe kindly requests thy presence in the eastern spaceport reliquary. I've been instructed to take thee there, at thy own discretion, of course."`

			`	They lead you through several restricted areas of the spaceport to a thin tower on its periphery. The room you enter into is tremendous and circular; a shallow watery depression in the center is matched by an enormous semicircular tank that bulges down from above, almost touching the floor as it swoops towards the wet floor. What's inside it proves even more striking, however: soon, what look like the severed limbs of Successors begin to writhe downwards in the tank, each suspended by a number of glittering golden threads that snake up into the dark abyss of the overhead water. You look around to ask your guide what's happening, but they have already left. One of the arms rubs up against the glass, its undead suckers making faint popping sounds as they pass over it.`

	`	"Captain <last>?" they ask.`
	`	"Yes?"`

	`	"I have," you say. "Fifty tons, as was requested." Tilra joins you in walking back to the <ship> to examine the cargo; when they're sufficiently satisfied that you've brought the proper amount, they pull out a data-pad and enter a couple of values. Though their eyes widen when you provide them with your receipts, they nonetheless confirm a few moments later that House Aqrabe has credited you to offset the purchase price of the keystones, plus a three hundred thousand-credit bonus.`
	`	As they begin directing ground crews to offload the keystones, Tilra turns to you for a moment and requests that you meet them back at the spaceport by the end of the day: "thine assistance might be a boon to us in the next part of this journey," they say.`

			`Several minutes pass after landing before the hull of the <ship> has cooled enough to make it safe for exit - despite Kaatrij's loaned technology, the ship's armor still glows red-hot. The interior of the garden's loading bay is cavernous, the tangled metal strands drawn inside onto giant spools each many meters in diameter.`
			`	Your crew gets to work under the supervision of Tilra and Kaatrij's observer, removing small bits of metal from the rolls and carting them, one by one, onto the ship. Soon, Tilra calls you over to a side section of the facility, and points out one of spools - unlike the others, this one is entirely empty.`

			`You set the ship down on <planet> in the midst of a sea of dockworkers, who begin removing the precious stellar metal from the <ship>'s cargo hold almost immediately, under the watchful gaze of the Kaatrij observer. Tilra, after entering a bit of data on their pad, finally relaxes, quietly reciting a series of harsh-sounding and apparently untranslatable words.`
			`	"Do you know something about those ships?" you ask them, eliciting a long groan and a wave of oily black over their skin.`
			`	"This is what we earn for tearing up a nest; going where we shouldn't," they say. "'Twas a drone, an automated guardian from the days that garden was new. No doubt meant to chase off interlopers, as ourselves. But-"`

				`	"What is it?"`
				`	"Spit it out!"`
			`	"Such a thing should not be. No House would've left a craft like that behind to molder, not for the sake of some petty metal. Heirlooms of that age are precious - I cannot see why such a thing should be so eas'ly discarded." They finally relax a bit, and the black wave subsides.`
			`	"Thou hast done us a duty, nonetheless. Thou shalt see thine account flusher soon."`

			`	"Now we put this bounty to work, captain. I and the others here have a long task before us: I believe we shall be able to split up the keystones and amplify their effects with the stellar metal - tis only a matter of how much and how well. There's little thou can do to assist now, though I'll be sure to note thy helpfulness to Aqrabe in this task."`
			choice
				`	"What about this ship? Do I get to keep it?`
			label ship
			`	Tilra nods. "Before we left, I heard from our fleet liason with Kaatrij. The ship lacks weapons or anything too perilous for thou to keep, and Kaatrij has no doubt already started removing their device. Thou might'st consider it a bonus to thy fee, a favor from the House to thee."`

			`	Tilra turns to go away but stops themself. "I've an apology to offer thee 'fore we part, captain," they say. "I showed thee some disrespect when we spoke before leaving. 'Tis strange to be accused by one so foreign to our ways. But we've been cut off a long time now, I think, hearing only from ourselves and the ghosts of others. Greater things are moving than either of us now, but thou may'st trust that I'll be careful with our treasure. I can promise thee nothing more, but thou'rt right to remind me of that, at least."`
			label "not confronted"
			`	The two of you are interrupted by Kaatrij's observer, who informs the two of you that the metal offloading is complete. Tilra, ready to get started on the next phase of their project, leaves with them, offering you a quick bow and courteous "goodbye."`
			`	A few minutes later, you are notified that you have received a payment of <payment> credits from House Aqrabe.`
