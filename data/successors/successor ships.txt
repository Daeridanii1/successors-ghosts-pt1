	description `Only very few figures within the largely destitute People's Houses have the resources to assemble such an extensively-modified vessel. The comfortable passenger quarters of the stock Ejniisde have been replaced with barracks and the star liner's lightweight hull has been laid over with heavy, multi-layered armor that shields a substantially expanded weapons suite.`
	description `	The construction of illegal warships such as these by the People's Houses has been a noted concern in many recent councils between the High Houses, prompting an increase in the size and prominence of their own military fleets.`

	description `The first prototype cloaks produced by the old House Kaatrij nearly eighteen hundred years ago were far from the adaptable and reliable technology they are today, each one consuming the power output of a large fusion reactor. It was only once the House's engineers started to incorporate a ship's shielding into the cloak's operation that they managed to make it truly practical; hence, even today, the efficient cloak of the Vujlet-Usaqri relies on a steady stream of shield energy to operate. Because of this, this modified variant of the Vujlet features a higher-capacity shield grid and more crew to maintain it.`
