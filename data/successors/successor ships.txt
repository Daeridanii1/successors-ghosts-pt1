	description `Only very few figures within the largely destitute People's Houses have the resources to assemble such an extensively-modified vessel. The comfortable passenger quarters of the stock Ejniisde have been replaced with barracks and the star liner's lightweight hull has been laid over with heavy, multi-layered armor that shields a substantially expanded weapons suite.`
	description `	The construction of illegal warships such as these by the People's Houses has been a noted concern in many recent councils between the High Houses, prompting an increase in the size and prominence of their own military fleets.`
