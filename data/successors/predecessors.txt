	description `Resja's ships didn't need shields for defence - only as fuel for attacking their foes. Thus, their favored shield cortex is an unusually powerful one, emitting a staggering amount of energy that is much less useful for intercepting damage than it is when fed back into a starship's systems.`

	description `Though not substantially different from its modern derivatives, this ancient reactor of the Myiaran Predecessors has few equals for raw power. Because it was designed  for Resja's drone ships that did not require a cool and comfortable crew, it generates more heat than most Myiaran generators, extracting more energy from this additional inefficiency.`

	description `With their shields devoted to other uses, Resja's warships relied on their dense armor to absorb incoming fire. From this repair unit, delicate strands of living metal spread out and intertwine with the layers of a ship's armor, coaxing it to regenerate from wounds much like an organic creature. These require a certain measure of shield energy to operate, however - modern craft will find that the armor longs to recieve damage even while shields are active.`
